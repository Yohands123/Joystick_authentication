Explanation of Code
Pin Definitions
SW_pin: Pin connected to the push button of the joystick.
X_pin and Y_pin: Analog pins connected to the X-axis and Y-axis outputs of the joystick.
Thresholds
THRESHOLD_HIGH: Upper limit for detecting movement in the positive direction.
THRESHOLD_LOW: Lower limit for detecting movement in the negative direction.
Any analog value between these thresholds represents the joystick in its center position.
Joystick States
An enum is used to define joystick states:

CENTER: The joystick is at rest.
RIGHT, UP, LEFT, DOWN: Directions corresponding to joystick movement.
Sequences
The system tracks:

Clockwise sequence: RIGHT → UP → LEFT → DOWN
Anti-clockwise sequence: DOWN → LEFT → UP → RIGHT
Core Functionalities
Joystick State Detection:

Based on the joystick's xValue and yValue from analog pins, the function getJoystickState() determines the current state.
Sequence Detection:

Clockwise Sequence:
If the detected state matches the next state in the clockwiseSequence, the index is incremented.
When the entire sequence is completed, the system sets clockwiseCompleted to true and resets the sequence tracker.
Anti-clockwise Sequence:
Works similarly to clockwise detection but tracks anticlockwiseSequence.
On completion, it sends an authentication signal (AUTH_SUCCESS) and resets the state.
Authentication:

If an anti-clockwise sequence is detected, the function sendAuthSignal() is called to notify the system (via Serial communication) that authentication was successful.
State Reset:

After a sequence is detected, the function resetStates() resets all sequence trackers and flags.
Serial Communication
Serial communication (Serial.begin(9600)):
Used to output status messages like "Joystick Authentication System Ready."
Sends "AUTH_SUCCESS" as the authentication signal when the anti-clockwise sequence is detected.
Debouncing
A delay(50) ensures the joystick movement is debounced to avoid rapid state changes being misinterpreted.
How It Works
When the joystick moves, the system tracks the direction using analog readings from X_pin and Y_pin.
If the joystick is moved in the specified clockwise or anti-clockwise sequence, the system detects it and performs an action:
Outputs a message: "Clockwise sequence detected" or "Anti-clockwise sequence detected."
Sends an authentication signal: "AUTH_SUCCESS" (only for anti-clockwise sequence).
How to Test
Connect the Joystick to the Arduino:

SW_pin → Digital Pin 2 (button, if needed for extension).
X_pin → Analog Pin A0.
Y_pin → Analog Pin A1.
Power and ground pins connected appropriately.
Upload the Code to the Arduino:

Open the Arduino IDE, copy the code, and upload it to the board.
Open Serial Monitor:

Set the baud rate to 9600.
Move the joystick in the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction.
Expected Output:

On successful clockwise sequence: "Clockwise sequence detected."
On successful anti-clockwise sequence: "Anti-clockwise sequence detected" and "AUTH_SUCCESS."
